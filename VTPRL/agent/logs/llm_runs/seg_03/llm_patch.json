  "explanation": "The previous attempt increased success_rate but led to a drop in mean_reward. This time, we will adjust approach_dist and delta_dist_weight within \u00b140% of their current values, focusing on increasing success_rate while maintaining a low collision_rate. We will keep them at 1.6 and 1.2 respectively, as they were effective in the last run without negatively impacting other metrics."
