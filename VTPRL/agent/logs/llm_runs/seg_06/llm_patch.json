  "explanation": "This time, we aim to boost success_rate while keeping collision_rate low. We will tweak progress-related constants (approach_dist, delta_dist_weight) and safety-related constants (laser_safe, collision_penalty). Approach_dist and delta_dist_weight are increased by 40%, ensuring better progress towards goals without compromising safety. Laser_safe is decreased by 40%, enhancing safety margins. Collision_penalty remains unchanged as per rule 3. This adjustment avoids the previous issue where increasing collision_penalty led to a drop in success_rate."
