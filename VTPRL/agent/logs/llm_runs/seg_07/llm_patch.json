  "explanation": "Increased approach_dist by 40% and delta_dist_weight by 40%. This avoids the previous issue where success_rate dropped, as both changes are within the allowed range and do not conflict with recent changes. Additionally, the increased delta_dist_weight may help in more accurately capturing the distance adjustments needed during navigation."
