max_updates: 40000              # Number of gradient update steps (stop earlier to avoid critic drift)
batch_size: 1024                # Minibatch size
alpha: 0.3                      # lower -> more BC exploitation, higher -> more TD3 exploitation

learning_rate: 1e-4             # Lower LR for more stable offline training
